# terminal_clock
My first useful program written in rust, I followed no tutorials, so this code is probably very suboptimal.

currently 5 text sizes are supported (1-5)

# Usage
after building, run with ``./terminal_clock``

the default clock text size is 1, this can be changed with the `--size` or `-s` flag
